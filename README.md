A place to store and version control my monthly projects hosted on Codepen. These projects will be things like games, data visualizations, and animations.

### Projects
    November 2016
[Winter Spring Summer Autumn](http://codepen.io/fleemaja/pen/bBoBxK "Winter Spring Summer Autumn") - animated tree scene that changes with the seasons (the tree grows leaves in the spring, leaves change color in the fall, etc.).

    December 2016
[Slither Snake](http://codepen.io/fleemaja/pen/zoRPMY "Slither Snake") - the classic 'snake' game with 'slither.io'-like fluid motion rather than the discrete grid organization and motion of the original.

    January 2017
Giphy Madlibs - This project will use the giphy api to add gif visuals to the user's completed madlibs story. User inputs will be used as giphy search queries (with a random gif chosen from the top results) to build a vertical wall of silly visuals alongside the story.
