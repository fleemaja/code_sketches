A place to store and version control my monthly projects hosted on Codepen. These projects will be things like games, data visualizations, and animations.

### Projects
    November 2016
[Winter Spring Summer Autumn](http://codepen.io/fleemaja/pen/bBoBxK "Winter Spring Summer Autumn") - animated tree scene that changes with the seasons (the tree grows leaves in the spring, leaves change color in the fall, etc.).

    December 2016
[Slither Snake](http://codepen.io/fleemaja/pen/zoRPMY "Slither Snake") - the classic 'snake' game with 'slither.io'-like fluid motion rather than the discrete grid organization and motion of the original.

    January 2017
[Mad Gifs](http://codepen.io/fleemaja/pen/YNQeXO?editors=0110 "Mad Gifs") - This project will use the Giphy api to add gif visuals to the user's completed Madlibs story. User inputs will be used as Giphy search queries to display silly visuals alongside the story.
